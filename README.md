# 🏨 Hospitality Analytics Dashboard – AtliQ Grand (Power BI Project)

This repository features a complete end-to-end Power BI analytics solution built for AtliQ Grand, an imaginary chain of five-star hotels operating across Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad.

The goal of the project was to analyze declining hotel performance and uncover insights that could drive better decision-making. Acting as a Data Analyst, I transformed raw operational data into actionable KPIs, meaningful visual narratives, and an interactive multi-page dashboard.

# ✅ Project Objective

To develop a dynamic, insight-driven dashboard that highlights key hospitality performance metrics such as revenue trends, booking behaviour, property-level gaps, and occupancy patterns—ultimately helping stakeholders identify opportunities for improvement.
